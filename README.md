# Machine Learning for prediction of elastic constants of isotropic material in Resonance Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS)

## Project Description
## Project Description
This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze and predict material properties using data obtained from Resonance Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS). The goal is to classify material types, including metals, polymers, and ceramics, and collect their material properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density. The data is simulated to obtain the resonance frequencies of each material. Machine learning and deep learning models are applied to predict Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio based on inputs such as eigenfrequencies, density, and geometric parameters.


## Features
- Preprocessing and normalization of RUS data
- Feature extraction from resonance frequencies
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Results visualization and analysis

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/ML-for-RUS.git
cd ML-for-RUS
pip install -r requirements.txt
