# Machine Learning for prediction of elastic constants of isotropic material in Resonance Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS)

## Project Description
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict material properties using data obtained from Resonance Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS). The goal is to classify material types and estimate their mechanical properties using features like resonance frequencies, density, and other material characteristics.

## Features
- Preprocessing and normalization of RUS data
- Feature extraction from resonance frequencies
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models
- Results visualization and analysis

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/ML-for-RUS.git
cd ML-for-RUS
pip install -r requirements.txt
